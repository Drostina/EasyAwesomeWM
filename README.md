# What is EasyAwesomeWm? 
It is a simple script that will install AwesomeWM and plenty of customised themes alongside your current distro's desktop. I made this for myself to go along with my PopOS setup as I am not a fan of the default gnome desktop.  

📝 ✔️ This is for those who want a functioning Awesome based desktop out of the box to modify parts of and experience the beauty of a dynamic tiling window manager without any hassle of setting it up from scratch\
📝 ❌ If you are a tinkerer and want to setup your own desktop, this project is maybe not for you

NOTE: The setup script is for a fresh install of awesome and the supplied themes and may override your configs, if you wish to keep your config please manually install the dotfiles yourself
